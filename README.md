If you have a solution to a problem that does not exist, feel free to make a PR! or if you find a mistake, create an Issue!

### Steps to contribute
- Create a [fork](https://github.com/mhmdsami/os/fork) of this repo.
- Clone it locally!
```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/os
```
- Add your solution in the correct directory ```<Topic>/<Sub_Topic>/<file_name>```, if the topic contains only one file, name it as `main.c` (or `main.cpp`) 
- Name your file descriptively, and look into the already existing files to get an idea. File names must be in ```snake_case```
- It is preferred that you run your code through prettier.
- Push the changes to your fork and make a PR! Make sure to include a screenshot of the question and the output.
